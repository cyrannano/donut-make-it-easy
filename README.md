# DoNut make it easy
C++ based interface that lets you look at donuts and other bizzare 3D shapes in your friendly neighbourhood terminal

## Lets keep it UNIX just for now

The main idea/goal is to rasterize 3D shapes in the terminal using ASCII characters

Being able to rasterize and render in real time a torus with an ability to rotate it with a fixed light source will be considered as a success.

# Todo
- [x] Get/Update terminal size info
- [ ] Draw ASCII character at given position
- [ ] Drawing 2D shapes
- [ ] Rotating 2D shapes
- [ ] Figure out the details about math behind 3D shapes rendering
- [ ] Dot product between light ray and 3D object to figure out the light intensity
- [ ] Object rotation, probably some matrix equations


# Changelog
## 0.0.0
- Initial commits
- Figuring out the environment/workspace
- Getting familiar with altering and gathering data from the terminal
